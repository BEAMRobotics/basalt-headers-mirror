## Basalt Headers

This repository is a custom fork of https://github.com/BEAMRobotics/basalt-headers-mirror. This repository differs in the following ways:
1. It is compiled with the c++ 14 standard rather than c++ 17
2. The serialization library has been removed
3. the test folder has been removed from this repository. The original repository has been tested and has not been modified.
3. It is meant to be compiled as a catkin package within a workspace
